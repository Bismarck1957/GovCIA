		<h3>Impact on Other Branches</h3>
			<p>The CIA is an independent agency, so it does not fall under any one branch. That being said, the CIA provides critical security information to senior US politicians and the President. The CIA collects information on foreign powers to help shape national security policy. Usually, the CIA works closely with the Department of State.</p>
		<h3>Impact of Other Branches</h3>
			<p>The CIA itself does not shape policy, it merely provides information that helps shape it. The CIA is not a police force; that would be the FBI. The CIA may also engage in covert action at the President’s direction and in accordance with applicable law. The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (D/CIA) is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. </p>
